## Instructions

As can be seen, I created the system using Laravel 6. For the database, I used migrations, so that I am going to put the prompt commands to run the system perfectly. 

PS: Prepare the file .env before run the comand below, in order to run the migration correctly.

- composer update

## About Webdev Challenge

First of all, I am very glad for the opportunity of coding for your company and overcoming this challenge. I put a lot of effort into finalizing it, however, due to my familiarity with Laravel, I performed it fastly. It was a real challenger for there were tons of details, such as date conversion, read of CSV files, besides the necessary creativity. So, I hope you guys enjoy the code contained here.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to show my job. I look forward to hearing from you.
